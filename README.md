# Basic-Portfolio
Pseudo-code
The only issue I encountered is putting the names of the interests in the portfolio area, I tried a few different ways of doing it, but each attempt broke the code that kept the images in the area I had them in, even after playing around with making the changes and trying to fix the issues that were caused by making the changes.
