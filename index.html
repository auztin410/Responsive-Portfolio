            What is there to say about me, I am a fun-loving, adventurous, wild at times goofball of a person. I enjoy writing, reading,
            watching movies, going to the gym, brewing the perfect cup of coffee, when I have time playing games, and now
            coding! Which is even more fun then I thought it would be.
            <br>
            <br> I can ramble and talk about many subjects and tend to go 110% into anything I get involved with, as I have a
            rather addictive personality, which seems will work hand in hand with coding.
